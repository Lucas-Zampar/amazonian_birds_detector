The set contains 940 images of Amazonian birds recorded by webcams from a residential feeder. For each image, there is an XML file containing the annotations for that image (Pascal VOC format). In total, 1,836 annotations were made between 5 species popularly known in Portuguese as __canário-do-amazonas__ (orange-fronted yellow-finch), __chupim__ (shiny cowbird), __rolinha__ (ground dove), __sanhaço-da-amazônia__ (blue-gray tanager) and __sanhaço-do-coqueiro__ (palm tanager).
