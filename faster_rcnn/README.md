# IMPORTANT NOTE

This folder should contain the checkpoints of the models trained in both the preliminary and final phases. In addition, it will also be possible to find the model evaluation metrics saved in csv tables, in addition to the confusion matrix figures. Due to storage limitations, these files were not shared here. However, you can find them [in the full repository shared by Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ueqV4UuxU2ebdD4YYV4xpQZ3hxHhIk-?usp=drive_link).
