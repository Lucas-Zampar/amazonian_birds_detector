# &#x26A0; IMPORTANT NOTE &#x26A0;


This folder should contain the checkpoints of the models trained in both the preliminary and final phases. However, due to storage limitations, the checkpoints have not been shared here. You can download them from [the full repository shared by Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12ueqV4UuxU2ebdD4YYV4xpQZ3hxHhIk-?usp=drive_link). Additionally, it is possible to find the evaluation metrics for each model in csv tables.

The most important model, the definitive model, is shared on the `final_test/model_0/` folder. The baseline is shared on `hyperparameter_tuning/model_14/` folder. You can better visualize the results with the [make_report_csv_files notebook](https://github.com/Lucas-Zampar/amazonian_birds_detector/blob/main/project_codes/make_report_csv_files.ipynb).
